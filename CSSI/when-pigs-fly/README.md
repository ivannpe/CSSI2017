# Lab - When Pigs Fly
There are some basic jQuery events in my_script.js, and a cute image of a pig in
pig.html.  Copy these files to your machine.


## Step 1: Animate the Pigs when you Click the Button
Right now the pigs just disappear and reappear. You want them to fade, fly and zoom. Add a new button called "Fly" that makes the pig move.
* Check out the animate documentation to get this to happen.
* In CSS, make sure div is styled to have `position: absolute`

## Step 2: Removing the Buttons
Use what you learned about jQuery events to have the pig "fly" when you click on the image themselves, not the button.

## Step 3: Add a New Pig
Modify the HTML to add a new pig *to the right* of your current pig. You might have to play around with the CSS layout properties.

## **Stretch:** Follow the Leader
Create an event where once the first pig flies away, the other one follows automatically after a set period of time.
